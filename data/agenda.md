# Screenings

*Bisbee ‘17* (dir. Robert Greene, 2018)

> Bisbee ’17 is a nonfiction feature film by award-winning filmmaker
> Robert Greene set in Bisbee, Arizona, an eccentric old mining town
> just miles away from both Tombstone and the Mexican border. Radically
> combining collaborative documentary, western and musical elements, the
> film follows several members of the close-knit community as they
> attempt to reckon with their town’s darkest hour: the forcible
> deportation of 1300 striking miners by a deputized posse, at the
> behest of the Phelps Dodge Corporation in 1917. For more information
> on the film, visit their [website](https://www.bisbee17.com/about).
> 
> This exclusive screening of the multiple award winning film, Bisbee
> ‘17, is a collaboration between the I+R and A+C tracks, and will be 
> followed by a discussion featuring the award-winning director
> Robert Greene and Katherine Benton Cohen, associate professor of 
> history at Georgetown University and historical advisor for the film. 

*Poverty, Inc.* (dir. Michael Matheson Miller, 2014)  

> This powerful documentary examines the “big business” of the global
> poverty industrial complex. The West has positioned itself as the
> protagonist of development, giving rise to a vast multi-billion dollar
> poverty industry — the business of doing good has never been better.
> Yet the results have been mixed, in some cases even catastrophic, and
> leaders in the developing world are growing increasingly vocal in
> calling for change. Drawing from over 200 interviews filmed in 20
> countries, Poverty, Inc. unearths an uncomfortable side of charity we
> can no longer ignore. The screening will be followed by a discussion
> with the director.
