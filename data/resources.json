    "rules":"## Full Rules\n1. Suggest ideas that will benefit the RadicalxChange community. \n1. We're aiming to raise $10,000 in matching funds from philanthropic supporters.\n1. You'll need to sign in to verify your email address. Only email addresses associated with the conference are eligible to participate. \n1. After the fundraiser ends and we have secured matching funds, we'll reach out to people who've pledged by email to collect donations.\n1. Pledges are not legally binding; however, if you pledge and don't follow through, we may exclude you from future fundraisers. \n1. Donations will not represent any form of ongoing interest or security in projects that are funded.\n1. The RadicalxChange Foundation reserves the right not to carry forward any proposals that are unfeasible, illegal, or otherwise inconsistent with the [mission](/about/#mission-statement) of the organization. But our overwhelming goal is to empower, not censor.\n1. You may only make one pledge per idea, but you can change or remove your pledge amount at any time until the fundraiser closes.\n1. We are using the [Capital-Constrained Liberal Radical](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656) matching mechanism. The slider below shows how matching funds would change according the alpha value specified in the matching formula. We will set a final alpha value when the fundraiser ends, depending on the pledges and matching funds received.\n1. Once the fundraising is closed, the RadicalxChange foundation will work with the community to find the right people to implement funded projects."

Glen was also recognized as a Bloomberg Top 50, one of Wired Magazine’s 25 leaders shaping the next 25 years of technology, and one of Coindesk’s most influential people in blockchain in 2018.",
