## Mission and Values  
  
### Mission Statement  
  
RadicalxChange convenes a community of activists, artists, entrepreneurs and scholars committed to using dramatically expanded competitive, free and open market mechanisms to reduce inequality, build widely-shared prosperity, heal global political divides and build a richer and more cooperative social life. As advocates of radical social change, the RadicalxChange community challenges long-established social institutions such as private property, one-person-one-vote and the primacy of the individual on the one hand and the nation state on the other. To achieve this change the community seeks to increase public knowledge about the emancipatory potential of insights from the field of mechanism design, in dialog with a range of other academic fields such as computer science, philosophy and history, the communicative imagination of artists, the pragmatic ingenuity of entrepreneurs and the idealism of activists for social justice.
  
### Core Values

 - **Open**: RadicalxChange is open. It seeks to facilitate a free exchange of ideas in an environment of thoughtful discourse.
 - **Egalitarian**: Many of the ideas at RadicalxChange are animated by a belief that hyper-concentrations of wealth are not natural or efficient, and that a more genuinely competitive market system would result in a broader distribution of wealth.
 - **Dignity**: Every person’s well-being (financial or otherwise) is a good in itself. We want our work to reflect and express this.
 - **Social Innovation**: At RadicalxChange we embrace the challenge of overturning stale categories and assumptions! We believe that thoughtful, collaborative innovation can help build better social institutions.

### Governance Principles

 - **Diversity**: To build a truly broad-based and effective community, we include the insights and perspectives of a wide range of social interests, political backgrounds, identity groups and vocational expertise. Leaders at all levels of RadicalxChange strive to actively include people within their remit who differ from them along all these dimensions but share the mission.
 - **Decentralization**: RadicalxChange is fundamentally anti-authoritarian in outlook and seeks to be the change it wishes to promote. Leaders at all levels of RadicalxChange strive to push decision-making authority outward to the extent possible, recognizing the substantial informal authority they hold as leaders and seeking primarily to include and draw upon members of the community wherever possible rather than aggregating decision-making authority in their own hands.
 - **Responsibility**: RadicalxChange leaders are chosen for their expertise in their respective areas of responsibility and take responsibility for ensuring engagement, quality decision-making, fair representation of their domain externally and the consistency of internal participation and governance with other RadicalxChange principles.
 - **Social Justice Mission**: RadicalxChange is primarily devoted to achieving its social justice mission, rather than achieving the private goals of any member. RadicalxChange should not become a source of personal enrichment for any individual to the exclusion of the community.
 - **Respect**: RadicalxChange community members treat each other as epistemic and social equals and should aim to empathize with the intellectual and personal perspective each member of the community brings to the table.

  
## Our Community  
    
### Community Overview  
  

RadicalxChange is an inclusive, open community that seeks to promote rich and meaningful connections across a wide range of people from all walks of life. We believe in diversity of opinion and representation across different ethnicities and races, genders and sexual orientations, religions, nationalities, and socio-economic and professional backgrounds.

  
We have four primary ‘tracks’ in our community, across which we actively promote dialogue and the xChange of ideas, passions, partnered experimentations and building - namely, Activism and Government, Arts and Communications, Entrepreneurship and Technology and Ideas and Research.
  
### Local Chapters and Meetups

RadicalxChange chapters are self-organized community groups working to educate and experiment with egalitarian market mechanisms.  Finding or founding a local chapter is a great way to learn and contribute to the ongoing conversation.  Please note that RadicalxChange Foundation Ltd. does not direct, and is not responsible for, the actions or events of local chapters or chapter organizers.

## Attendance and Agenda

### Tickets

Check this section regularly for ticketing information. To purchase tickets through eventbrite, [click here.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/radicalxchange-tickets-53060613724)

The first round of general admission tickets will become available on January 9th 5pm EST. There is a limited number of tickets, so buy them as soon as you can! Our early bird tickets sold out in 48 hours. The price will increase for round two of general admission sales. Tickets are not for resale. IDs will be checked at the door. In line with RadicalxChange's values, these tickets are being sold to real unique humans (that's you!) not as commodities, so we want to make sure it is the inspired community members who will contribute to the event that are showing up with the tickets they purchased.

We want the event to be accessible to everyone, especially those that might not otherwise be able to pay full price. We are therefore proud to offer scholarships consistent with our values. That being said, if you have the means to pay, we encourage you to purchase a ticket before they sell out as scholarships will be limited and carefully evaluated. To learn more about the types of scholarships we offer and the process for getting them, read the section below.


### Scholarship Information


RadicalxChange is offering four types of scholarships this year: Radical Action Scholarships for builders, Diversity and Equity Scholarships to ensure inclusivity, Student Scholarships to make sure we have young voices and minds present, and Community Organizer Scholarships for people founding or involved with local RxC chapters. These scholarships are intended for those individuals who cannot afford a general admission ticket -- please only apply if this is true for you. Scholarship tickets will grant you the same access as a general admission ticket.


#### Types of Scholarships 

 - **Radical Action Scholarship**: Are you working on a project that applies ideas inspired by Radical Markets? We want people building on these ideas to be able to attend the conference and gain the insight they need to propel their projects forward. The RadicalxChange community is made up of developers, researchers, artists, entrepreneurs, activists and more. This scholarship is suited for those working on small projects, a few months to two years old, those with less than five employees, or those with little access to capital. If you are unsure about whether or not you meet these qualifications, we encourage you to apply and describe the size and capabilities of your organization. **[Apply Here.](http://bit.ly/RadicalActors)**
 - **Diversity and Equity Scholarship**: Diversity is vital to the success of the RxC mission. Do you come from a community that is typically underrepresented at conferences like this? We want to make sure that cost is not a burden that prevents you from attending. Some examples of groups that are not always well represented include racial and ethnic minorities, women, low-income attendees, disabled attendees, members of the LGBT community, and members from developing countries -- members of underrepresented communities that are not listed above are also welcome to apply. **[Apply Here.](http://bit.ly/DiversityandEquity)**
 - **Student Scholarship**: Are you a student interested in the ideas shared within Radical Markets or the RadicalxChange Community? Young people will shape the future, and we believe these ideas will help build a brighter one. We do not want cost to prevent you from attending, so by proving that you currently attend a high school, university, or other institution of higher learning you can receive a highly discounted ticket. **[Apply Here.](http://bit.ly/RadicalStudent)**
 - **Community Organizer Scholarship**: If you have founded a local RadicalxChange chapter, or are a regular participant within a local chapter, you are eligible for this scholarship. This is the shortest application because most of the information about you will be verified externally by either the chapter founder (if you are a participant) or by the RadicalxChange chapter coordinator (if you are a founder). **[Apply Here.](http://bit.ly/RadicalCommunity)**


#### Scholarship Process

Scholarship applications do not correspond with regularly priced ticket waves and applications are currently live. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis, but we encourage you to apply as soon as possible. We will continue to process and award scholarships until all scholarship tickets available have been allocated. We would love to provide scholarships to all those in need, but unfortunately the number of scholarship tickets we can offer is limited.

Please direct all questions regarding scholarships to: [ticketing@radicalxchange.org](mailto:ticketing@radicalxchange.org)

#### Screenings

*Bisbee ‘17* (dir. Robert Greene, 2018)

> Bisbee ’17 is a nonfiction feature film by award-winning filmmaker
> Robert Greene set in Bisbee, Arizona, an eccentric old mining town
> just miles away from both Tombstone and the Mexican border. Radically
> combining collaborative documentary, western and musical elements, the
> film follows several members of the close-knit community as they
> attempt to reckon with their town’s darkest hour: the forcible
> deportation of 1300 striking miners by a deputized posse, at the
> behest of the Phelps Dodge Corporation in 1917. For more information
> on the film, visit their [website](https://www.bisbee17.com/about).
> 
> This exclusive screening of the multiple award winning film, Bisbee
> ‘17, will be followed by a panel discussion featuring the
> award-winning director, Robert Greene, and Katherine Benton Cohen,
> associate professor of history at Georgetown University and historical
> advisor for the film. 

*Poverty, Inc.* (dir. Michael Matheson Miller, 2014)  

> This powerful documentary examines the “big business” of the global
> poverty industrial complex. The West has positioned itself as the
> protagonist of development, giving rise to a vast multi-billion dollar
> poverty industry — the business of doing good has never been better.
> Yet the results have been mixed, in some cases even catastrophic, and
> leaders in the developing world are growing increasingly vocal in
> calling for change. Drawing from over 200 interviews filmed in 20
> countries, Poverty, Inc. unearths an uncomfortable side of charity we
> can no longer ignore. The screening will be followed by a discussion
> with the director.
