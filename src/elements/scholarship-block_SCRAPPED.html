          <h2 class="">Radical Action Scholarship: $400</h2>
          <p>
            Are you working on a project that applies ideas inspired by Radical Markets? We want people building on
            these ideas to be able to attend the conference and gain the insight they need to propel their projects
            forward. The RadicalxChange community is made up of developers, researchers, artists, entrepreneurs,
            activists and more. This scholarship is suited for those working on small projects, a few months to two years
            old, those with less than five employees, or those with little access to capital. If you are unsure about
            whether or not you meet these qualifications, we encourage you to apply and describe the size and
            capabilities of your organization.

          <p>
            Diversity is vital to the success of the RxC mission. Do you come from a community that is typically
            underrepresented at conferences like this? We want to make sure that cost is not a burden that prevents
            you from attending. Some examples of groups that are not always well represented include racial and
            ethnic minorities, women, low-income attendees, disabled attendees, members of the LGBT community,
            and members from developing countries â€” members of underrepresented communities that are not listed
            above are also welcome to apply. Apply Here.

          <p>
            Are you a student interested in the ideas shared within Radical Markets or the RadicalxChange
            Community? Young people will shape the future, and we believe these ideas will help build a brighter one.
            We do not want cost to prevent you from attending, so by proving that you currently attend a high school,
            university, or other institution of higher learning you can receive a highly discounted ticket. Apply Here.

          <p>
            If you have founded a local RadicalxChange chapter, or are a regular participant within a local chapter, you
            are eligible for this scholarship. This is the shortest application because most of the information about you
            will be verified externally by either the chapter founder (if you are a participant) or by the RadicalxChange
            chapter coordinator (if you are a founder). Apply Here.
